Basics of SwiftUI
SwiftUI is a framework introduced by Apple for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Released in 2019, SwiftUI allows developers to create UIs using a declarative Swift syntax, which simplifies and accelerates the development process.

Key Features of SwiftUI

- Declarative Syntax: SwiftUI uses a declarative syntax, meaning you describe what your UI should do and SwiftUI takes care of the details. This contrasts with the imperative style of UIKit where you have to specify every step to create and manage views.

- State Management: SwiftUI makes it easy to manage and update the state of your application. It automatically keeps the UI in sync with the underlying data.

- Cross-Platform: With SwiftUI, you can create a single codebase that works across all Apple platforms, adapting to each platform’s conventions and user interface guidelines.

- Live Previews: SwiftUI integrates with Xcode’s design tools, providing live previews of your UI as you code. This helps in rapidly prototyping and iterating on designs.

- Built-in Animations: SwiftUI includes powerful and easy-to-use animation capabilities, allowing developers to add animations to their apps with minimal code.

- Composition and Reusability: SwiftUI encourages creating reusable components, which can be composed together to build complex user interfaces.
